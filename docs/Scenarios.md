Example-Scenario:
* Felipe has a ship of the line
* I can/want only build frigates
* How many frigates do I need to beat his ass?!

Stats:
* ship of the line: 
    * hitpoints: 4000
    * damages per second: 53
* frigate: 
    * hitpoints: 2500
    * damage per seconds: 28

$$\frac{1}{\frac{2500}{53}*\frac{4000}{28}}~=3,03$$

3 frigates would be enough, because of higher attack rate and other stuff

Formula with flexible target amount:

$$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{TargetAmount}*SecondsToYourDestruction*SecondsToDestroy}=Amount$$
