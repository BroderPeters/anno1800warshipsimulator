# Basics 

$$\frac{TargetHitPoints}{YourDamagePerSecond}=SecondsToDestroy$$

Your time to destroy has to reach the time to destroy your enemy needs.

$$\frac{YourHitPoints}{TargetDamagePerSecond}*x>=\frac{TargetHitPoints}{YourDamagePerSecond}$$

e.g. 
* One frigate needs ~143 seconds to destroy a ship of the line.
* One ship of the line needs ~47 seconds to destroy a frigate.
* Where `x` is the amount of needed frigates.

$$\frac{2000}{53}*x>=\frac{4000}{28}$$
$$38*x>=143$$
$$x>=\frac{143}{38}$$
$$x>= 3,76$$

* Therefore you need ~4 frigates to destroy a ship of the line.

# Single source type

You pick one type of ship you have/are building.

## One target type

You pick one type of ship your enemy has.

$$\frac{TargetAmount*SecondsToYourDestruction}{SecondsToDestroy}=Amount$$

## Multi target Type

You pick the types of ship you enemy has.
